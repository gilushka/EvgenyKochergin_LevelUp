Arrietty's Song (English Song)

I'm forteen years old, I'm pretty.
I'm a teeny tiny girl, a little lady.
I Live under the kitchen floor,
Right here, not so far from you.

Some times I feel happy,
Some times I feel blue.
In my dreams... Oh ! I wish I could

Feel my hair blowing in the wind,
See the sky in the summer rain.
Pick a flower from the garden for you...

Beyond the lane,there's another world,
Butterflies floating in air...
But is there someone out there for me...?

And so life goes on,day after day,
With kick-knacks on the floor, nooks & crannies.
I live in a tiny world...
(live in a tiny world)
But out there,someone waits for me...
